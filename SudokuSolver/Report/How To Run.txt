To run the solver, input command line arguments like so:
SudokuSolver.exe S [inputFileName] [HeuristicLevel] [outputfile]

Ex: 
SodokuSolver.exe S hard.txt 5

Where inputFileName is the name of the file you want to program to solve and HeuristicLevel is an number 1 - 5 of the Huertistic level you want to run. The outputFile is an optional argument you can specify for writing the output of a solution to a file.

The heuristic levels are detailed below:

Heuristic Levels:
1: Backtracking only (BT)
2: Backtracking plus Forward checking (BT + FC)
3: BT + FC + minimum remaining values (MRV)
4: BT + FC + MRV + Degree Heuristic (DH)
5: BT + FC + MRV + DH + Least Constraining Value (LCV)

To run the generator, input command line arguments like so:
SudokuSolver.exe G [inputFileName] [outputFileName]

Ex:
SudokuSolver.exe G input.txt output.txt

Where inputFileName is the name of the input file to read in from and outputFileName is the name of the output file.
